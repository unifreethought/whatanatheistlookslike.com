				<h1 style="font-family:helvetica">Coming Out As An Atheist</h1>

				<p>Coming out as an atheist can be quite intimidating. For 
				some it's as simple and non-controversial as posting a 
				Facebook status. For others it can mean problems with family, 
				friends, and separation from the community that religion 
				provides. </p>

				<p>Yet coming out can be very important. We only have this one 
				life to live, and people should not have to hide who they are 
				from the people they care about. They should not be afraid to 
				keep their beliefs secret for fear of backlash. <strong>Being 
				an atheist is not wrong</strong>. It does not make you a bad 
				person. If people are offended, then <strong>that is their 
				problem</strong>, and they need to learn to deal with people 
				who do not share their beliefs and values. Of course there 
				are times when people should only come out to certain people. 
				If coming out means being kicked out of your house, or facing 
				emotional or physical abuse, then it's probably not a good 
				idea. Things like that do happen, although rarely. </p>

				<p><a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/atheistactivism/p/ComeOutFamily.htm">This About.com webpage</a> 
				offers some good advice for individuals thinking of outing 
				themselves as an atheist. It's worth reading if you're 
				partially or wholly closeted about your beliefs.</p>
